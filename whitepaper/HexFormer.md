# Dual-Foundation Architecture Model White Paper:
# Universal Semantic Generation System Based on 2^n Symbolic Structure and 8-bit Representation

## Abstract

This white paper proposes a semantic generation and reasoning framework that fuses binary structural length (2^n) with fixed bit-stack (8-bit) representation, aimed at addressing the disconnection between symbolic structures and computational efficiency in semantic modeling. By utilizing I-Ching-style symbolic combinations as semantic node structures, and using 8-bit information streams natively compatible with modern processors as low-level computational units, this system architecture achieves alignment between semantic and computational levels, providing a dual-fusion computational paradigm for AGI foundation cores with reasoning capabilities and expressiveness. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that this architecture shows significant advantages in reasoning consistency, computational efficiency, and multimodal generation, opening up new design approaches for next-generation artificial intelligence systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Background

Current neural language models commonly adopt token-based encoding and high-dimensional floating-point representations, lacking direct alignment with underlying information processing structures, leading to inconsistencies between semantic generation and computational efficiency. Although these models have achieved significant success in specific tasks, they face several fundamental challenges:

- **Computational Efficiency Bottlenecks**: High-dimensional floating-point operations result in high energy consumption and difficulty deploying on resource-constrained devices
- **Semantic-Computational Disconnect**: Lack of natural mapping between semantic representations and underlying computational units increases model complexity
- **Reasoning Capability Limitations**: Existing models perform inadequately in structured reasoning and symbolic operations, making reliable multi-step reasoning difficult

On the other hand, fundamental symbolic systems such as the I-Ching system (64 hexagrams) and DNA codons (64 combinations) provide clearly structured symbolic combination mechanisms with inherent combinatorial logic and state transition capabilities, yet are difficult to directly implement in neural network architectures. These ancient symbolic systems exhibit deep associations with information encoding, revealing the universality of 2^n structures in information representation.

### 1.2 Research Motivation

This research aims to fuse the above two systems:

* Using the **2^n structural model** as semantic node rhythm and inferential structure (macro-symbolic topology)
* Using the **8-bit signal stack model** as the lowest unit of the neural computation layer (micro-operational representation)

To establish a semantic generation and symbolic evolution model that can be integrated from top to bottom. This fusion not only pursues improvements in computational efficiency but also aims to create an information processing architecture with inherent consistency, achieving harmonious unity between semantic representation and computational representation.

### 1.3 Theoretical Foundation and Innovation Points

The core innovation of this white paper lies in identifying and utilizing two key observations:

1. **Universality of 2^n Structure in Symbolic Systems**: From the 64 hexagrams of I-Ching to DNA codons, from computer instruction sets to information encoding, 2^n structures demonstrate an astonishing consistency as basic units of information organization

2. **Hardware Affinity of 8-bit Processing**: Modern computing architectures have native support for 8-bit operations, providing a natural bridge from theory to practice

Through the fusion of these two structural levels, we create an AI system framework that both conforms to cognitive semantic principles and is highly adaptable to modern computing architectures.

## 2. Dual-Foundation Architecture Definition

### 2.1 2^n Symbolic Layer (Symbolic Lattice Layer)

#### 2.1.1 Structural Definition

* **Basic Unit**: Symbolic units composed of n-bits (typically 6-bit, yielding 64 combinations)
* **Combination Rules**: Combination logic based on positional encoding, such as the specific meanings of the six lines in I-Ching hexagrams
* **Hierarchical Structure**: Symbols form directed graph networks with hierarchical propagation characteristics
* **State Transitions**: Define "line change" (bit flip) rules to establish transition paths between states

#### 2.1.2 Mathematical Representation

Define the symbol space $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_{2^n}\}$, where each symbol $s_i$ can be represented as an n-dimensional binary vector:

$$s_i = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n], b_j \in \{0, 1\}$$

Define the line change operator $\Phi_j$, representing the flipping of the j-th bit:

$$\Phi_j(s_i) = [b_1, ..., \overline{b_j}, ..., b_n]$$

Construct a symbol transition graph $G = (S, E)$, where the edge set $E$ contains all possible line change transitions.

#### 2.1.3 Application Scenarios

* Provide semantic category nodes, state transition rhythms, and context switching logic
* Construct frameworks and path planning for structured reasoning
* Implement consistency frameworks for cross-modal mapping
* Examples: 64 hexagrams (6-bit), DNA codons (6-bit), classification tree nodes

### 2.2 8-bit Representation Layer (Bit Stack Semantic Layer)

#### 2.2.1 Structural Definition

* **Basic Unit**: 8-bit (1 byte) as the minimum processing unit
* **Representation Space**: Each byte can represent 256 states, with multiple bytes capable of constructing representations of arbitrary complexity
* **Operation Set**: Supports bit operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, SHIFT) and byte-level arithmetic operations
* **Parallel Processing**: Compatible with SIMD instruction sets, supporting parallel byte operations

#### 2.2.2 Mathematical Representation

Define the byte vector space $B = \{b | b \in \{0,1,...,255\}\}$, with semantic entities represented as byte sequences:

$$e = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m], b_i \in B$$

Define byte-level attention mechanism:

$$Attention(Q, K, V) = Softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$$

where Q, K, V are byte-granularity query, key, and value matrices.

#### 2.2.3 Advantages

* Supports low-bit vector operations, quantized training, bit masking, and logical operations
* Efficient memory performance and SIMD/hardware affinity
* Reduces computational complexity and power requirements
* Adaptable to edge devices and embedded systems

## 3. Fusion Mechanism Design

### 3.1 Level Alignment Logic

#### 3.1.1 Mapping Function Definition

Define a mapping function $M: S \rightarrow B^m$ from the symbol space to the byte representation space, mapping each n-bit symbol to an m-byte representation:

$$M(s_i) = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_m]$$

This mapping is learned to ensure that semantically similar symbols map to neighboring regions in the representation space.

#### 3.1.2 Control Mechanism

* Use 2^n structures as semantic input rhythm controllers (Semantic State Index)
* Symbolic layer controls attention flow, determining information routing and processing priorities
* Establish conditional mapping between symbolic states and model parameters

### 3.2 State Transitions and Line Change Mapping

#### 3.2.1 Line Change Transformation Matrix

Define the line change transformation matrix $T$, describing the representation space transformation caused by unit bit changes:

$$T_{i,j} = \frac{\partial M(s)}{\partial s_j}|_{s=s_i}$$

This matrix captures the sensitivity of representation space to small changes in symbols.

#### 3.2.2 Attention Mechanism Mapping

* Define each bit flip as corresponding to a change in the model's attention structure
* Line changes are mapped to attention mask modifications or head selection changes:

$$Mask_{new} = Mask_{current} \oplus BitFlipPattern(j)$$

* Construct line change chains as attention flow sequences
